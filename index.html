          I've been building things my whole life, and I'm not stopping anytime
          soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to put useful new things into the hands of ordinary
          people, and I hope these few philosopies will get me there:
        </p>
        <p>
          The one who confuses motion with progress stands still.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you know how to learn, there's nothing else to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're all smart. Differentiate thyself by being kind.

                In just 12 months, Baas Bikes cut the cost of bikeshare
                systems by 90%. We operated these systems at 4 different

                I'm lucky to have spent so much time working in the realms of
                technology and entrepreneurship. While imperfect, both fields
                are fairly meritocratic and full of opportunity for the
                hard-working. Having been on the receiving end of many such
                opportunities, I think it's important to open the doors of these
                fields to those most in need of opportunity.
