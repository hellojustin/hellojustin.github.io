                Launching Bluetooth-based bikeshare systems

              <p>
                In just 12 months, Baas Bikes cut the cost of bikeshare
                systems by 90%. We operated these systems at 4 different
                universities, generating revenue from hourly app-based bike
                rentals.

              <p>
                In my first startup, I made a lot of mistakes, but I learned
                more in those few months than I had in my whole career at that
                time.

                One thing I love about the technology field is that it's
                fairly meritocratic and full of opportunity for the

                opportunities, I think it's important to open the doors of this
                field to those most in need of opportunity.

                Designed and built a Java-based desktop application that allowed
                researchers to explore Genetic Module Data at VA Tech's

                Modules are discovered by various statistical methods, and

                Launching Bluetooth-based bikeshare systems
              </h4>
              <p>
                In just 12 months, Baas Bikes cut the cost of bikeshare
                systems by 90%. We operated these systems at 4 different
                universities, generating revenue from hourly app-based bike
                rentals.

              <h4>Taking the risk of starting a business</h4>
              <p>
                In my first startup, I made a lot of mistakes, but I learned
                more in those few months than I had in my whole career at that
                time.

                ...by 400% during my tenure. Approximately 1/8th of that
                growth was attributable to development work that I led.

                One thing I love about the technology field is that it's
                fairly meritocratic and full of opportunity for the
                hard-working. Having been on the receiving end of many such
                opportunities, I think it's important to open the doors of this
                field to those most in need of opportunity.

                I go to a lot of concerts! Fun fact: I applied to college as a
                jazz guitar performance major, but switched to computer science
                before I arrived.
