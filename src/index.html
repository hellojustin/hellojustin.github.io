          I'm an optimist. In my work, I strive to invent things that improve
          the lives of individuals by pushing the boundaries of the possible.
          I draw daily on my entrepreneurial instincts and a technical and 
          professional background that spans the commercial sector, service 
          sector, and academia. I seek out new technologies, methodologies, and
          philosophies constantly. Over the past eight years, I've led teams and
          worked as an individual contributor, and have managed to produce some
          great results for some pretty cool organizations.

                CustomInk is the leading retailer of custom apparel for groups
                and occasions. Customers design products right in their web 
                browser and CustomInk handles the production and shipping with
                industry-leading turnaround times. During my tenure at
                CustomInk, the company has grown from 200 'Inkers' to over 1000.
                In fact, there's a pretty good chance that you own a CustomInk

                I lead a team of full-stack engineers who work on the 
                consumer-facing technology at CustomInk: our online design tool, 
                our group-purchasing tools, and Booster.com, our fundraising 
                platform. On the server-side, we use Ruby on Rails and have 
                embraced service orientation to organize our systems. To build a
                highly-interactive experience for our customers, we use a 
                variety of Javascript frameworks, including Backbone,
                Handlebars, RaphaelJS, jQuery, and ExtJS. I've also done a
                considerable amount of work with True Type Fonts, Adobe
                PostScript, and ImageMagick.

                As a Technical Team Lead, my primary responsibility is to help 
                the other engineers on my team do their best work. I regularly
                frame technical problems, communicate the business context of
                our technical work, seek and distribute information across the company,
                organize conversations that yield technical design decisions,
                improve our development process, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with
                my teammates to work through challenging problems. Every member
                of my team has either won CustomInk's annual company-wide award for
                innovation (1 award, 1000 Inkers) or has been promoted to a
                technical team lead role. Even our team's intern's code is still
                running in production.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this role, I also have the responsibility of supervising
                other engineers.

              <p>
                I'm not always actively leading, however. It's often the case 
                that I don't have the best ideas on the team, or the most 
                familiarity with a technology. When that happens, I step back 
                and follow. In those cases, I ensure the health of the project 
                by asking probing questions, and learning as fast as I can. I
                strive to set an example of consideration and contemplation.
                When our team considers eachother's ideas and is eager to learn,
                our best thinking rises to the top.

                I work extremely closely with our Product Managers and UX 
                Designers as well. Together, we discover business
                opportunities, decide which ones to tackle, how to tackle them,
                and when. This is where company strategy meets development 
                projects, and regularly involves advocating for certain projects
                and explaining why we shouldn't do others.

                Some notable business impact of my team's work includes:
                - Increased revenue by ~$5MM, reduced customer service time by
                8%, and improved customer satisfaction by 9% with the
                introduction of features that remove backgrounds and detect
                colors in uploaded artwork.
                - Increased revenue by ~$2MM and decreased customer service work
                with the introduction of draggable handles to resize text and
                images.
                - Doubled the rate at which customers place orders on Android
                and iOS devices by making our design lab touch-compatible.

                Netuitive is a predictive analytics platform that helps IT
                organizations avoid downtime and service-degredations before 
                they occur. Netuitive learns the normal behavior for each
                component in an organization's IT infrastructure, and
                understands how it relates to other components. When a component
                deviates from normal, Netuitive can proactively alert
                administrators as to which parts of the infrastructure will be
                affected, and when.
              </p>
            </header>
            <div class='technology'>
              <p>
                The core Netuitive product is a Spring Framework application 
                that is shipped via downloadable installers for Windows and
                Linux. The installer installs Tomcat, provisions the database, 
                and deploys the application. After the initial installation,
                administrators can install additional packages that add features
                and integrate with other performance monitoring tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Netuitive, I added several reporting features to the core
                product, but my more interesting work was on a secondary product
                called Hydra. Along with two other engineers, I built hydra 
                using Groovy and Grails that allowed customers running several
                instances of the core product to aggregate and view data across 
                all instances. This product also added Single-Sign-On to the 
                core product. I also worked on third-party integrations with 
                NetIQ and IBM Tivoli.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='leadership'>
              <p>
                I think I surprised a few people with how quickly I came up to
                speed on what is a rather complex product. Shortly after I 
                arrived at Netuitive, I was influencing development decisions,
                corresponding with third-party vendors with whom we had
                partnerships, and presenting my work to senior company
                leadership.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also spent several months mentoring an intern, who still works
                for Netuitive today.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='entrepreneurship'>
              <p>
                Perhaps my biggest accomplishment at Netuitive was building a
                well-performing integration with IBM's Tivoli. At the time,
                Tivioli represented about one third of the application
                performance management market, yet its APIs were too slow for us
                to effectively integrate. I used a unique approach which allowed
                Netuitive to effeciently read Tivoli data, opening up a whole
                new set of potential customers. This work positioned me to win
                Netuitive's "Rookie of the Year" award.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also cultivated a relationship with Netuitive's director of
                solution architecture, and supported him on difficult
                proof-of-concept demonstrations at customer sites.

                Computech is a software and project management consultancy with
                a core competency in wireless spectrum auctions, among other
                areas. While the bulk of my work was done for the United States'
                Federal Communications Commission, Computech used what it
                learned at the FCC to grow its spectrum auctions business in
                Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and Switzerland.

            <div class='technology'>
              <p>
                At the Federal Communications Commission, I worked to develop
                new features and improve the performance of the Integrated
                Spectrum Auctions System and the Universal Licensing System.
                Together, the two systems allocate and manage the usage of all
                airwaves in the United States. The two systems were built on a
                variety of technologies: Standard JEE, the Spring Framework, and
                Adobe ColdFusion. All components were hosted via BEA Weblogic
                and ran on top of Sybase.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most notably, I overhauled the system that generated printed
                licenses and correspondence so that spectrum license holders
                could retrieve pixel-perfect, historically accurate PDF copies
                (of the original PostScript version of the document) for all
                correspondence from the FCC.

            <div class='leadership'>
              <p>
                During the transition from analog to digital television in the
                US, I led the development of the DTV.gov website. The site took
                on many different forms during the transition and afterward, but
                much of the underlying technology and data models remained the
                same due my early design work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also the first person to introduce the Scrum methodology
                at Computech. Introducing Scrum at a CMMI Level III organization
                is no walk in the park, but we managed to learn enough about how
                the project would have to work during the pilot project that we
                were able to make it a regular development methodology at the
                company.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my final year at Computech, I led a company wide transition
                from Yahoo Mail to Google Apps. The effort involved evaluating
                a number of intranet tools, building consensus among company
                leadership, making the technology switch, and training the 250
                employees on the basics of Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sites.
                Ultimately, the switch made collaboration far easier, and for
                my effort, I won the company's "Above and Beyond Award".

            <div class='entrepreneurship'>
              <p>
                My entrepreneurial instincts were very much developing while I
                was at Computech. I could see the Cloud Computing trend emerging
                though, so I led an iniative to improve Computech's familiarity
                with Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine, and Rackspace. As a
                result, the company was able to speak intelligently about the
                tradeoffs of each, when most competitors only knew Cloud
                Computing as a buzz word.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also helped write the technology sections of several
                proposals. Most notably, I summarized Computech's spectrum
                auctions work at the FCC and its plans for improvements in a
                re-compete proposal that ultimately won a new 5-year, ~$100MM 
                contract with FCC.

                As an intern at CBIL, I built a desktop visualization tool

                module discovery algorithms and display their data in a way that
                allowed medical doctors to see and explore the commonalities
                between them. The tool itself was built using J2SE Swing with 
                custom AWT components, and it read data generated by AffyMetrix
                MicroArray chips.

                The majority of my work at CBIL was done independently, with
                monthly check-ins from a senior professor. It was largely up to
                me to decide what techonologies to use, what to build, and how.
                Upon graduating from college, I helped to on-board a new

                Academic research is not intrinsically entrepreneurial, but the
                potential impact of this work was never lost on me. If we could
                identify a cluster of genes, that when under- or over-expressed,
                cause disorders like Muscular Dystrophy or Cancer, it could be
                possible for medical doctors to create a 'healthy' virus that
                would infect the affected cells, reverse the genetic anomaly,
                and cure the affliction.

              <h4>Automated Hovercraft</h4>
              <p>
                My capstone project at CUA was a cross disciplinary effort to
                build a hovercraft that could carry landmine detection
                equipment. It proved to be a multi-year effort that was
                continued by the following senior class, but we managed to pitch
                the idea to the US Army Night Vision Lab as well as the US State
                Department's Humanitarian De-Mining division. As a result of
                those pitches and our early prototypes of the GPS guidance and
                thrust system, we managed to win a $65,000 grant for the 
                University to fund the remainder of the project.

              <h4>Ad-Hoc Wireless Routing</h4>
              <p>
                During my Junior year, I completed a directed study in which I 
                collaborated with a computer science professor and another 
                computer science student to develop and test a hybrid routing 
                protocol for wireless ad-hoc networks using simulation software
                and actual wireless motes.

              <h4>Magna Cum Laude</h4>
              <p>
                During my 4 years at Catholic University, I maintained a 3.71
                cumulative GPA, with a 3.9 GPA in my major of computer science.
                I made the dean's list 6 out of 8 semesters.

              <h4>John Welch Award</h4>
              <p>
                Upon graduation, I received the John Welch Award for outstanding
                leadership and academic performance in the Department of
                Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
