            <p>
              I'm an optimist. In my work, I strive to invent things that improve
              the lives of individuals by pushing the boundaries of the possible.
              I draw daily on my entrepreneurial instincts and a technical and 
              professional background that spans the commercial sector, service 
              sector, and academia. I seek out new technologies, methodologies, and
              philosophies constantly. Over the past eight years, I've led teams and
              worked as an individual contributor, and have managed to produce some
              great results for some pretty cool organizations.

                  CustomInk is the leading retailer of custom apparel for groups
                  and occasions. Customers design products right in their web

                    I lead a team of full-stack engineers who work on the 
                    consumer-facing technology at CustomInk: our online design tool, 
                    our group-purchasing tools, and Booster.com, our fundraising 
                    platform. On the server-side, we use Ruby on Rails and have 
                    embraced service orientation to organize our systems. To build a
                    highly-interactive experience for our customers, we use a 
                    variety of Javascript frameworks, including Backbone,
                    Handlebars, RaphaelJS, jQuery, and ExtJS. I've also done a
                    considerable amount of work with True Type Fonts, Adobe
                    PostScript, and ImageMagick.

                    As a Technical Team Lead, my primary responsibility is to help 
                    the other engineers on my team do their best work. I regularly
                    frame technical problems, communicate the business context of
                    our technical work, seek and distribute information across the company,
                    organize conversations that yield technical design decisions,
                    improve our development process, and sit shoulder-to-shoulder with
                    my teammates to work through challenging problems. Every member
                    of my team has either won CustomInk's annual company-wide award for
                    innovation (1 award, 1000 Inkers) or has been promoted to a
                    technical team lead role. Even our team's intern's code is still
                    running in production.

                    I'm not always actively leading, however. It's often the case 
                    that I don't have the best ideas on the team, or the most 
                    familiarity with a technology. When that happens, I step back 
                    and follow. In those cases, I ensure the health of the project 
                    by asking probing questions, and learning as fast as I can. I
                    strive to set an example of consideration and contemplation.
                    When our team considers eachother's ideas and is eager to learn,
                    our best thinking rises to the top.

                    I work extremely closely with our Product Managers and UX 
                    Designers as well. Together, we discover business
                    opportunities, decide which ones to tackle, how to tackle them,
                    and when. This is where company strategy meets development 
                    projects, and regularly involves advocating for certain projects
                    and explaining why we shouldn't do others.

                    Some notable business impact of my team's work includes:
                    - Increased revenue by ~$5MM, reduced customer service time by
                    8%, and improved customer satisfaction by 9% with the
                    introduction of features that remove backgrounds and detect
                    colors in uploaded artwork.
                    - Increased revenue by ~$2MM and decreased customer service work
                    with the introduction of draggable handles to resize text and
                    images.
                    - Doubled the rate at which customers place orders on Android
                    and iOS devices by making our design lab touch-compatible.

                  Netuitive is a predictive analytics platform that helps IT
                  organizations avoid downtime and service-degredations before 
                  they occur. Netuitive learns the normal behavior for each
                  component in an organization's IT infrastructure, and
                  understands how it relates to other components. When a component
                  deviates from normal, Netuitive can proactively alert
                  administrators as to which parts of the infrastructure will be
                  affected, and when.

                  <p>
                    The core Netuitive product is a Spring Framework application 
                    that is shipped via downloadable installers for Windows and
                    Linux. The installer installs Tomcat, provisions the database, 
                    and deploys the application. After the initial installation,
                    administrators can install additional packages that add features
                    and integrate with other performance monitoring tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At Netuitive, I added several reporting features to the core
                    product, but my more interesting work was on a secondary product
                    called Hydra. Along with two other engineers, I built hydra 
                    using Groovy and Grails that allowed customers running several
                    instances of the core product to aggregate and view data across 
                    all instances. This product also added Single-Sign-On to the 
                    core product. I also worked on third-party integrations with 
                    NetIQ and IBM Tivoli.

                    I think I surprised a few people with how quickly I came up to
                    speed on what is a rather complex product. Shortly after I 
                    arrived at Netuitive, I was influencing development decisions,
                    corresponding with third-party vendors with whom we had
                    partnerships, and presenting my work to senior company
                    leadership.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also spent several months mentoring an intern, who still works
                    for Netuitive today.

                  <p>
                    Perhaps my biggest accomplishment at Netuitive was building a
                    well-performing integration with IBM's Tivoli. At the time,
                    Tivioli represented about one third of the application
                    performance management market, yet its APIs were too slow for us
                    to effectively integrate. I used a unique approach which allowed
                    Netuitive to effeciently read Tivoli data, opening up a whole
                    new set of potential customers. This work positioned me to win
                    Netuitive's "Rookie of the Year" award.

                  <p>
                    I also cultivated a relationship with Netuitive's director of
                    solution architecture, and supported him on difficult
                    proof-of-concept demonstrations at customer sites.

                  Federal Communications Commission, Computech used what it
                  learned at the FCC to grow its spectrum auctions business in

                  <p>
                    At the Federal Communications Commission, I worked to develop
                    new features and improve the performance of the Integrated
                    Spectrum Auctions System and the Universal Licensing System.
                    Together, the two systems allocate and manage the usage of all
                    airwaves in the United States. The two systems were built on a
                    variety of technologies: Standard JEE, the Spring Framework, and
                    Adobe ColdFusion. All components were hosted via BEA Weblogic
                    and ran on top of Sybase.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most notably, I overhauled the system that generated printed
                    licenses and correspondence so that spectrum license holders
                    could retrieve pixel-perfect, historically accurate PDF copies
                    (of the original PostScript version of the document) for all
                    correspondence from the FCC.

                    During the transition from analog to digital television in the
                    US, I led the development of the DTV.gov website. The site took
                    on many different forms during the transition and afterward, but
                    much of the underlying technology and data models remained the
                    same due my early design work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was also the first person to introduce the Scrum methodology
                    at Computech. Introducing Scrum at a CMMI Level III organization
                    is no walk in the park, but we managed to learn enough about how
                    the project would have to work during the pilot project that we
                    were able to make it a regular development methodology at the
                    company.

                  <p>
                    In my final year at Computech, I led a company wide transition
                    from Yahoo Mail to Google Apps. The effort involved evaluating
                    a number of intranet tools, building consensus among company
                    leadership, making the technology switch, and training the 250
                    employees on the basics of Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sites.
                    Ultimately, the switch made collaboration far easier, and for
                    my effort, I won the company's "Above and Beyond Award".

                    My entrepreneurial instincts were very much developing while I
                    was at Computech. I could see the Cloud Computing trend emerging
                    though, so I led an iniative to improve Computech's familiarity
                    with Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine, and Rackspace. As a
                    result, the company was able to speak intelligently about the
                    tradeoffs of each, when most competitors only knew Cloud
                    Computing as a buzz word.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also helped write the technology sections of several
                    proposals. Most notably, I summarized Computech's spectrum
                    auctions work at the FCC and its plans for improvements in a
                    re-compete proposal that ultimately won a new 5-year, ~$100MM 
                    contract with FCC.

                  CBIL (for short) was a well-funded Virginia Tech laboratory that
                  conducted reserearch in the area of Gene Module Discovery, using
                  unsupervised machine learning and other statistical techniques.

                  <p>
                    As an intern at CBIL, I built a desktop visualization tool 
                    called ModVis that read the output files of many different
                    module discovery algorithms and display their data in a way that
                    allowed medical doctors to see and explore the commonalities
                    between them. The tool itself was built using J2SE Swing with 
                    custom AWT components, and it read data generated by AffyMetrix
                    MicroArray chips.

                    The majority of my work at CBIL was done independently, with
                    monthly check-ins from a senior professor. It was largely up to
                    me to decide what techonologies to use, what to build, and how.
                    Upon graduating from college, I helped to on-board a new 
                    graduate student who continued the work after I left.

                  <p>
                    Academic research is not intrinsically entrepreneurial, but the
                    potential impact of this work was never lost on me. If we could
                    identify a cluster of genes, that when under- or over-expressed,
                    cause disorders like Muscular Dystrophy or Cancer, it could be
                    possible for medical doctors to create a 'healthy' virus that
                    would infect the affected cells, reverse the genetic anomaly,
                    and cure the affliction.

                    In November of 2006, I published and presented my work at the
                    19th International Conference on Computer Applications in 
                    Industry and Engineering in Las Vegas, NV.

                        I made the dean's list 6 out of 8 semesters.

                      <p>
                        My capstone project at CUA was a cross disciplinary effort to
                        build a hovercraft that could carry landmine detection
                        equipment. It proved to be a multi-year effort that was
                        continued by the following senior class, but we managed to pitch
                        the idea to the US Army Night Vision Lab as well as the US State
                        Department's Humanitarian De-Mining division. As a result of
                        those pitches and our early prototypes of the GPS guidance and
                        thrust system, we managed to win a $65,000 grant for the 
                        University to fund the remainder of the project.
