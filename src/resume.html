            <h3 class='title'>Technical Team Lead</h3>
            <p>
              Led a team of 4 engineers within an agile product team
              responsible for CustomInk's Design Lab. Collaborated closely with
              product managers and UX designers. Managed the development process
              (Kanban) for numerous product improvements, which contributed ~50%
              revenue growth during a 3-year period of ~400% overall revenue
              growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aligned engineering interests with business interests by
              instilling a culture of pragmatism and contextual awareness.
              Moderated architecture discussions, mentored team members and
              interns, recruited new team members, negotiated contracts,
              advocated R&amp;D efforts to executive team, and planned team
              outings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each member of my team earned CustomInk's annual
              "Innovation" Award (1 award, 1000 Inkers), or was promoted to a
              Technical Lead role during my tenure. I, myself, was nominated
              each year for the "Golden Rule" Award.
            </p>
            <p>
              During summer of 2013, led engineering team responsible for
              Booster.com's organizer dashboard. Booster was a in-house startup
              at the time, and is now a wholly owned subsidiary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Individually contributed numerous full-stack features involving
